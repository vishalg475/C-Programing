WHAT IS C PROGRAMMING???

C is a General-Purpose Programming Language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboraties in 1972.
C is Very fast, Compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.
It can be used in both Applications and Technologies.

ADVANTAGES OF C PROGRAMMING?
*Easy to write and understand
*Quick Compilation

WHAT ARE VARIABLES?
Variables are Containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.

BASIC DATA TYPES:

The Data type Specifies the size and type of information the variable will store.
DATA TYPES:-

int   stores Whole numbers

float  Stores decimal Values
Double  Stores Upto 15 Decimal Numbers
Char  Stores a Single Character/Letter/Name

FORMAT SPECIFIERS:
There are different Format Specifiers for each data type.

FORMAT SPECIFIER          DATA TYPE

%d, %i                    int
%f, %F                    float
%Lf                       double
%c                        char

IF SYNTAX

if(condition) {
// content
}
Example :-
if (20>18){
printf("20 is greater than 18");
}

ELSE STATEMENT:
if(condition) {
printf(content)
}
else {
printf(content)
}
Example:-

int time=20;
if(time<18){
printf("Good Day");
} else {
printf("Good Evening");
}

ELSE IF STATEMENT :
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false;

if(Condition){
printf(content)
} else if (condition2) {
printf(content)
} else {
printf(content)
}

NESTED IF ELSE :
A Nested if else statement is an if statement inside another if statement. The General Syntax of nested if-else Statement in C is as Follows:-

if(condition1){
/*code to be executed if condition1 is true*/
if(condition2){
/*code to be executed if condition2 is true*/
}else{
/*code to be executed if condition2 is false*/
}
}else{
/*code to be executed if condition1 is false*/
}

FOR LOOP STATEMENT :
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
Syntax:-
for (expression1; expression2; expression3)
{
code block to be executed
}

WHILE LOOP STATEMENT:
The while loop loops through a block of codes as long as a specified condition is true:

Syntac:

While(condition){
//code block to be executed.
}

GENERAL RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES ARE:-
Names can contain letters, digits and Underscores
Names Must begin with a ladder or a underscore(_)
Names cannot contain Whitespaces or Special Characters like !,#,%,etc..,
Reserved words (such as int)cannot be used as names.
